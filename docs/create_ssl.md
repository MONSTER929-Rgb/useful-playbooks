# [‚Üê](https://github.com/truewebartisans/useful-playbooks) `create_ssl` playbook

Creates a new website folder (called as domain name) and SSL certificate (_thanks to [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)_) for it. Included the best practice for `Nginx` config and task for CRON to renew.

## Usage

```bash
ansible-playbook \
                  create_ssl-playbook.yml \
                  --user <USER> \
                  --extra-vars "host=<HOST> domain=<DOMAIN>"
```

### Extra vars

- `<USER>` (**required**/_optional_) remote user's username (for example, `root`)
- `<HOST>` (**required**) hostname in your inventory (from `/etc/ansible/hosts` file)
- `<DOMAIN>` (**required**) domain name without `www` part (for example, `website.com`)

> üëå Yes, actually you can specify the `<USER>` argument in your `/etc/ansible/hosts` file and do not place it here. We use the `{{ ansible_user }}` variable in playbook to point to the remote user.
>
> ‚òùÔ∏è Please note: Certbot can create the SSL certificates for both `website.com` and `www.website.com`.
